			<h2>Worker visibility in frontline health</h2>

			<p>Frontline health workers like home health aides or community health workers serve as the backbone of their respective health systems but are vulnerable workers who face challenges due to their lack of clinical status and identities as predominantly women or people of color. I am investigating how technology could help them receive the support, respect, and recognition they deserve.

				<ul>
					<li>Interviewed FHWs in NYC and India about what invisible work they do and what they do about it.</li>
					<li>Presented at workshops (<a href="https://joycming.medium.com/a-tale-of-two-frontline-health-workers-cdd1019d3f82">CHI 2022</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-wS8jlM2rT3r5Ev6zzhlpyvZutLFgI0-1RUbrg1NOhw/edit">CSCW 2021</a>) and submitted papers that are conditionally accepted.</li>
				</ul>

	<h2>Response bias in accessibility</h2>
	<p>Accessibility technology can really help reduce barriers for people with disabilities, but its history is filled with examples of well-intentioned but ultimately harmful technology. This is potentially a result of response bias, where <b>participants of research studies may not answer in a way that represents what they actually think</b> because they feel pressured by the power dynamic with the researcher or study design.

		<ul>
			<li>Interviewed researchers about manifestations and mitgations in their research (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3441852.3471216">ASSETS 2021</a>).</li>
			<li>Started experiments to see if participants demonstrate the response bias researchers described.</li>
		</ul>

	</p>

	<h2>Previous projects in social impact</h2>
	<p>In the past at Google and Harvard, I have also worked on projects with marginalized communities:

		<ul>
			<li>Empowered <b>small-businesses, entrepreneurs, and gig workers</b> in the US and all over the world (2018-2020).</li>
			<li>Enabled users in low-connectivity settings to <b>download and share files offline</b> on Chrome and other Google products (2016-2017).</li>
			<li>Built <b>hybrid tools that were a mix of paper and digital</b> for rural health centers dealing with maternal and child health (2012, 2014-2015).</li>
			<li>Analyzed autism data from clinical settings and online medical forums using topic models, along with other projects in <b>AI & health information</b> (2015).</li>
		</ul>
