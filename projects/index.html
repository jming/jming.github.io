    <h2>Current</h2>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Response bias in accessibility research.</b> Understanding how HCI researchers interact with participants with disabilities and how that might influence the participants' responses.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Invisible work of caregivers.</b> I'm conducting focus groups and interviews with frontline caregivers and their superiors to understand how data about the undervalued labor that has been rendered "invisible" can help caregivers advocate for their power.</p></li>
	</ul>
	</p>
    <h2>Past</h2>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Future of work and small businesses.</b> As a tech lead and user researcher in Google's internal incubator, <a href="https://area120.google.com/" target="_blank">Area 120</a>, I explored the possibilities for the future of work to empower entrepreneurs and gig workers in the US and all over the world with <a href="https://www.strideworks.com" target="_blank">Stride</a> (2020), <a href="https://www.kormo.com" target="_blank">Kormo</a> (2019), and Ally (2018).
		</p></li>

		<li><p><b>Offline files.</b> I built technologies that help people, primarily in India and Sub-Saharan Africa, to download files on Chrome (2017) and share them offline on Youtube Go and, eventually, Files Go (2016).</p></li>

		<li><p><b>Paper-digital tools in rural health.</b> I explored the persistence of paper and the practicality of digital tools in low-resource settings, designing and implementing hybrid tools on the paper-digital spectrum for rural health centers with <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2909628" target="_blank">Beyond the partograph</a> (2015), <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2909649" target="_blank">printr</a> (2014), and Raxa JSS EMR (2012).
		</p></li>

		<li><p><b>Artificial intelligence and health information.</b> I researched different means of collecting and analyzing health information through my <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/14398542" target="_blank">undergraduate thesis</a> in topic models and autism data from clinical settings and online medical forums (2015) and my assistance building tools for care plan management for children with complex conditions (2015).</p></li>
