			<h2>Data Advocacy for the Visibility of Home Care Workers</h2>

			<p>
				Technology solutions have been proposed to address the "care gap" that the United States has been facing due to a low supply of caregivers. Rather than continuing to develop such technologies that burden, invisibilize, and surveil workers, my dissertation research looks to see how technology could be used to advocate for the workers, amplifying their voices and highlighting their work (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3584931.3608922" target="_blank">CSCW'23 DC</a>).
				<ul>
					<li>First, I investigated the sociotechnical mechanisms of invisible work through interviews with home care workers (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3579492" target="_blank">CSCW'23</a>).</li>
					<li>Then, I explored how technology could be designed to address questions of visibility through design provocations and focus groups with workers and worker advocates.</li>
					<li>Finally, I am developing a system that could help home care workers collect and share data to change their circumstances.</li>

			<h2>Other Projects in Social Impact and Technology</h2>

			<p>My non-dissertation PhD projects include:</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Interviewing researchers on the manifestations and response bias in their interactions with participants with disabilities (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3441852.3471216" target="_blank">ASSETS'21</a>).</li>
					<li>Interviewing frontline health workers in NYC and India about the invisible work they do and how technology could help them receive the support, respect, and recognition they deserve (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3530190.3534814" target="_blank">COMPASS'22</a>).</li>
					<li>Applied natural language processing to civic data collected by the NYC citywide participatory budgeting process.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>In the past at Google and at Harvard, I've also worked on other projects helping small-business entrepreneurs and gig workers in the US and all over the world (2018-2020), designing hybrid tools along the paper-digital spectrum for rural health centers (2014-2016, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2909649" target="_blank">ICTD'16</a>), and analyzing data from clinical settings and online medical forums using topic models (2015, <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/14398542" target="_blank">undergrad thesis</a>).</p>
