	<h2>Current projects</h2>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Response bias in accessibility research.</b> Research in accessibility technology requires the participation of disabled people. However, the power dynamic inherent in this researcher-participant relationship makes it likely that there will be response bias, or the participants' responses being affected by different factors like appealing to what the researchers want to hear or not feeling like they could fully express their opinions. Right now, I am interviewing both researchers and participants of these accessibility technology research studies to understand what their experiences have been regarding response bias to start the conversation about it in the accessibility technology research community.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Invisible work of caregivers.</b> A lot of the labor done by frontline caregivers like home health aides or community health workers is rendered "invisible." However, understanding invisible work can help highlight the value of the labor to the caregivers themselves and their superiors. I am conducting focus groups and interviews with caregivers and their superiors to understand their perceptions of invisible work and how this data might be able to help caregivers advocate for their power.</p></li>

	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Future of work and small businesses.</b> As a tech lead and user researcher in Google's internal incubator, <a href="https://area120.google.com/" target="_blank">Area 120</a>, I explored the possibilities for the future of work to empower entrepreneurs and gig workers in the US and all over the world with <a href="https://www.strideworks.com" target="_blank">Stride</a> (2020), <a href="https://www.kormo.com" target="_blank">Kormo</a> (2019), and Ally (2018).
		</p></li>

		<li><p><b>Offline files.</b> I built technologies that help people, primarily in India and Sub-Saharan Africa, to download files on Chrome (2017) and share them offline on Youtube Go and, eventually, Files Go (2016).</p></li>

		<li><p><b>Paper-digital tools in rural health.</b> I explored the persistence of paper and the practicality of digital tools in low-resource settings, designing and implementing hybrid tools on the paper-digital spectrum for rural health centers with <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2909628" target="_blank">Beyond the partograph</a> (2015), <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2909649" target="_blank">printr</a> (2014), and Raxa JSS EMR (2012).
		</p></li>

		<li><p><b>Artificial intelligence and health information.</b> I researched different means of collecting and analyzing health information through my <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/14398542" target="_blank">undergraduate thesis</a> in topic models and autism data from clinical settings and online medical forums (2015) and my assistance building tools for care plan management for children with complex conditions (2015).</p></li>
