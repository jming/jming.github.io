I am starting this blog to document my travels into the world after graduation--the world beyond school, routine, and comfort. I'll be writing a lot about my Fulbright project next year and I'll hopefully write more often than I have in the past. I'll try to keep them short and interesting--comments and suggestions welcome. Stay tuned!
