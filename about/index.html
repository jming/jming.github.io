	<h1>Joy C. Ming</h1>
	<p>I'm currently a <a href="http://www.usief.org.in/US-Fulbright-Nehru-Fellowships.aspx">Fulbright-Nehru Student Research Scholar</a> studying technology and maternal health in India with <a href="www.dimagi.com">Dimagi</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/tem/default.aspx">Microsoft Research</a>. I graduated cum laude in field from Harvard in May 2015 with a degree in computer science and global health. I am interested in the application of technology in the global health sphere, having worked on projects with hospitals in India, Ghana, Uganda, and various cities in the United States and co-founded the <a href="developersfordevelopment.org">Harvard College Developers for Development</a>. I love drinking tea and exploring new places through reading and travel.</p>
