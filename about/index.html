	<h1>Joy C. Ming</h1>
	<p>I'm currently a Fulbright-Nehru Scholar studying technology and maternal health in India with Dimagi and Microsoft Research. I graduated Harvard in May 2015 with a degree in computer science and global health. I am interested in the application of technology in the global health sphere, having worked on projects with hospitals in India, Ghana, Uganda, and various cities in the United States and co-founded the Harvard College Developers for Development. I love drinking tea and exploring new places through reading and travel.</p>
