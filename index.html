		<p>Hi, I'm <b>Joy (she/her)</b>!</p>
		
		<p>I am an <a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/information/news/newsitem1035/3-info-sci-phds-receive-nsf-graduate-research-fellowships" target="_blank">NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a>
			and final year PhD Candidate at 
			<a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/ming" target="_blank">Cornell Information Science</a> 
			advised by <a href="https://www.adityavashistha.com/" target="_blank">Aditya Vashistha</a> and <a href="http://nixdell.com/" target="_blank">Nicola Dell</a>. 
			<b><mark>I am on the academic job market in Fall 2024</mark></b>, looking for postdocs and faculty positions starting Fall 2025. 
		</p>

		<p><b>My goal is to increase the participation of marginalized voices in the design, development, and deployment of AI and data-driven tools in order to mitigate and resist technological harms.</b> I do this by: (1) innovating ways communities could leverage AI and data-driven tools to build collective power, (2) pioneering more equitable research and design methods, and (3) activating the next generation of ethical, critical, and empowered creators of technology.</p>

		<p>My dissertation research investigates the tradeoffs between the potential benefits and harms of data-driven advocacy for home care workers in Upstate New York in partnership with Healthcare Workers Rising and 1199SEIU.</p>

		<p>I have over a decade of experience in academia and industry designing and building technologies for social impact in diverse geographies (e.g., the United States, South/Southeast Asia, West Africa) and multiple domains (e.g., disability justice, global health, civic engagement, labor organizing). My research has been recognized with prestigious awards (e.g., Fulbright, NSF Graduate Fellowship), makes contributions to several disciplines (e.g., HCI, CSCW, ICTD, STS), and has real-world impact (e.g., open source technological artifacts, public-facing writing).</p>
