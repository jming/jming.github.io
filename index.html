		<p>Hi, I'm Joy!</p>
		
		<p><b>
			I am designing and building technology that gives power to marginalized communities, 
			both in the position of the technology in larger social change movements 
			and the inclusion of more voices in the process of creation itself.
		</b><p>

		<p>
			As a first year PhD student in information science at Cornell advised by 
			<a href="https://www.adityavashistha.com/">Aditya Vashistha</a> and <a href="http://nixdell.com/">Nicola Dell</a>, 
			my research involves <b>design justice, disability studies, and global health equity</b>. 
			My previous experiences as a software engineer/user researcher at Google, Fulbright researcher, 
			and co-founder of the Harvard College Developers for Development 
			have given me experience understanding the role of technology in social change and designing and building technology for 
			job seekers in Asia, entrepreneurs in Africa, and hospitals in India, Ghana, and the US.
		</p>

		<p>
			I also enjoy exploring in cities, nature, and books and creating food and art.
			I've been sharing some of what I've been learning through visual summaries of books and courses &mdash; 
			check out my <a href="/thoughts">thoughts</a> page for some examples!
		</p>

		<p>
			Please reach out if any of this resonates with you &mdash; 
			I love connecting with people interested in or working on social impact tech!
