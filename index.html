		<p>Hi, I'm <b>Joy (she/her)</b>!</p>
		
		<p>I am currently at Cornell as a Postdoctoral Associate at the <a href="https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/carow" target="_blank">Center for Applied Research on Work</a> at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations
			<!-- working with <a href="https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/people/ariel-c-avgar" target="_blank">Ariel Avgar</a>. -->

			<b>In Spring 2026, I will be starting as an Assistant Professor in the new <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/ai-society.html" target="_blank">AI and Society</a> Department at the University at Buffalo.</b>
			<b><mark>I am recruiting PhD students for Fall 2026 who are: (1) excited about both people <i>and</i> technology, (2) passionate about community and social impact, and (3) experienced in resonant research methods (e.g., qualitative, systems design/development, computational/data).</mark></b>

			I study <b>care and collectivity in the age of AI</b>. I conduct community-engaged, interdisciplinary research to answer questions such as: 
			What do care and care work look like with the datafication, automation, and humanization accompanying emerging technologies? 
			How might AI technologies be designed in a way that can account for care and other human, emotional, and relational elements? 
			How can communities reimagine and reclaim AI tools towards collective care and collective action? 
			I have done this research in many contexts, focusing on home health care in Upstate New York, USA for my dissertation.
		</p>
		
		<!-- <p><b>My research examines the relationship between emerging technologies and worker voice.</b> 
			I use community-engaged methods to ensure that low-wage, frontline workers
			<!-- (especially those who perform relational labor or focus on care work)  -->
			are not left behind during the introduction of new technologies &mdash;
			that their concerns are reflected in the design and governance of data-driven technologies and that they are empowered to organize and advocate in response to or even leveraging data and AI.
			<!-- I study this especially in the context of occupations that center care work, as relational labor presents unique challenges for AI and automation and opportunities for workers to reshape power dynamics. -->
			I study this especially in the context of care and relational labor, focusing on home health care in Upstate New York, USA in my dissertation.</p>
			<!-- My dissertation focused on these questions in the context of home health care in the United States (more specifically, Upstate New York).</p> --> -->

		<!-- <p><b>My goal is to increase the participation of marginalized voices in the design, development, and deployment of AI and data-driven tools in order to mitigate and resist technological harms.</b> I do this by: (1) innovating ways communities could leverage AI and data-driven tools to build collective power, (2) pioneering more equitable research and design methods, and (3) activating the next generation of ethical, critical, and empowered creators of technology.</p> -->

		<!-- <p>My dissertation research focuses on home health care, where there is an opportunity to shift from the surveillance of top-down, government-mandated technology to the solidarity that amplifies the voices of diverse and isolated workers.</p> -->
			<!-- investigates the tradeoffs between the potential benefits and harms of data-driven advocacy for home care workers in Upstate New York in partnership with Healthcare Workers Rising and 1199SEIU.</p> -->

		<p>I have over a decade of experience in academia and industry designing and building technologies for social impact in diverse geographies (e.g., the United States, South/Southeast Asia, West Africa) and multiple domains (e.g., disability justice, global health, civic engagement). My research has been recognized with prestigious awards (e.g., Fulbright, NSF Graduate Fellowship), makes contributions to several disciplines (e.g., HCI, CSCW, ICTD, STS), and has real-world impact (e.g., open source technological artifacts, public-facing writing).</p>
