		<p>Hi, I'm Joy (she/her)!</p>
		
		<p><b>I create technology that shifts power to marginalized communities.</b></p>
		
		<p>I am currently a first year PhD student at 
			<a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/ming">Cornell Information Science</a>.
			My research is in human-computer interaction (HCI) and information and communication technologies for development (ICTD),
			involving <b>design justice, disability justice, global health equity, and the future of work</b>.
			I am advised by <a href="https://www.adityavashistha.com/">Aditya Vashistha</a> and <a href="http://nixdell.com/">Nicola Dell</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>I have almost a decade of experience designing and building technologies to reduce health inequities and fill resource gaps
			for entrepreneurs in Asia (India, Indonesia, Bangladesh), Africa (Ghana, Nigeria), and the US (Boston, Portland, Dallas)
			as a software engineer/user researcher at Google, Fulbright student research scholar, and co-founder of Harvard College Developers for Development.
    </p>

		<p>
			I also enjoy exploring (cities, nature, and books) and creating (food and art).
			I've been sharing some of what I've been learning through visual summaries of books and courses &mdash; 
			check out my <a href="/thoughts">thoughts</a> page for some examples!
		</p>

		<p>
			Please reach out if any of this resonates with you &mdash; 
			I love connecting with people interested in or working on social impact tech!
