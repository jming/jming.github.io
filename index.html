	<p>Hi, I'm Joy!</p>

	<p>I am passionate about creating technology with marginalized populations in a way that maintains justice and equity.</p>

	<p>In the fall I will be starting a PhD in Information Science at Cornell. I'm currently a user researcher and software engineer at Google and I have worked on projects related to what Google refers to as "<a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/next-billion-users/">next billion users</a>." I have also done research and built software with hospitals in India, Ghana, and the US as a <a href="http://www.usief.org.in/US-Fulbright-Nehru-Fellowships.aspx">Fulbright student researcher</a>, visiting researcher at NYU Abu Dhabi, and co-founder of the <a href="developersfordevelopment.org">Harvard College Developers for Development</a>.</p>
