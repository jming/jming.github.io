		<p><b>My research goal is to amplify the voices of marginalized communities through and within technology design by working closely with community-based organizations and underrepresented students.</b></p>

			for entrepreneurs in Asia (India, Indonesia, Bangladesh), Africa (Ghana, Nigeria), and the US (NYC, Boston, Portland, Dallas)
