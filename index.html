		<p>Hi, I'm Joy!</p>

		<p><b>I make technology that is part of social change to give power to people who don't traditionally have it, like people with disabilities or nurses in rural India.</b></p>

		<p>As a first year PhD student in information science at Cornell, my research involves human-computer interaction, participatory design, disability studies, and global health equity. My previous experiences at Google, as a Fulbright researcher, and co-founder of the Harvard College Developers for Development have given me experience understanding the role of technology in social change and designing and building technology for job seekers in Asia, entrepreneurs in Africa, and hospitals in India, Ghana, and the US.</p>

		<p>I also enjoy exploring in cities, nature,and books and creating food and art. My latest creations include experimenting with 5 different kinds of cheesecake ;)</p>

		<p>Please reach out if any of this resonates with you &mdash; I love connecting with people interested in or working on social impact tech!</p>
