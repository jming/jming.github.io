	<p>Hi, I'm Joy!</p>

	<p>
		I'm a user researcher and software engineer at Google. 
		In Fall 2020, I will be starting a PhD in Information Science at Cornell University. 
		I am passionate about creating technology with marginalized populations in a way that maintains justice and equity.

		At Google I've worked on projects related to small businesses in the US, unemployed youth in Asia, startups in Africa, and on technology used for offline file sharing in emerging markets.
		In the past, I've done research and built software with hospitals in India, Ghana, and various cities in the US as a <a href="http://www.usief.org.in/US-Fulbright-Nehru-Fellowships.aspx">Fulbright-Nehru Student Research Scholar</a>, visiting research at NYU Abu Dhabi, and a co-founder of the <a href="developersfordevelopment.org">Harvard College Developers for Development</a>.
