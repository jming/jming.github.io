		<p><b>My research examines how community organizers could leverage data and technology to build collective power while accounting for technological harms.</b> My PhD research explores data-driven advocacy for home care workers in partnership with a union-affiliated organization.</p>
		<p>I use qualitative interviews/focus groups, community-based collaborative design, and coding/computational analysis. My work mainly contributes to human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and engages critically with science and technology studies (STS), labor, and information and communication technologies for development (ICTD).</p>
				
		<p>I have almost a decade of experience designing and building technologies to reduce health inequities and fill resource gaps
			for entrepreneurs in Asia (India, Indonesia, Bangladesh), Africa (Ghana, Nigeria), and the US (NYC, Boston, Portland, Dallas) 
			as a software engineer/researcher at Google, Fulbright research scholar, and co-founder of the Harvard College Developers for Development.
    </p>

<!-- 		<p>
			I also enjoy exploring (cities, nature, and books) and creating (food and art).
			I've been sharing some of what I've been learning through visual summaries of books and courses &mdash;
