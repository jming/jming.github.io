		<p>Hi, I'm <b>Joy (she/her)</b>!</p>
		
		<p>I am currently an <a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/information/news/newsitem1035/3-info-sci-phds-receive-nsf-graduate-research-fellowships">NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a>
			and PhD Candidate at 
			<a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/ming">Cornell Information Science</a> 
			advised by <a href="https://www.adityavashistha.com/">Aditya Vashistha</a> and <a href="http://nixdell.com/">Nicola Dell</a>.
		</p>

		<p><b>My research goal is to amplify the voices of marginalized communities through and within technology design by working closely with community-based organizations and underrepresented students.</b></p>
		
		<p>I use qualitative interviews and focus groups, designing and building technologies, and computational analysis.
			My work contributes to the study of of design justice, global health equity, and the future of work.</p>
		
		<p>I have almost a decade of experience designing and building technologies to reduce health inequities and fill resource gaps
			for entrepreneurs in Asia (India, Indonesia, Bangladesh), Africa (Ghana, Nigeria), and the US (NYC, Boston, Portland, Dallas).
    </p>

		<p>
			I also enjoy exploring (cities, nature, and books) and creating (food and art).
			I've been sharing some of what I've been learning through visual summaries of books and courses &mdash; 
			check out my <a href="/thoughts">thoughts</a> page for some examples!

		<p>
			<b>Please reach out if any of this resonates with you</b> &mdash; 
			I love connecting with people interested in or working on social impact tech!
