		<p>Hi, I'm <b>Joy (she/her)</b>!</p>
		
		<p><b>I create technology that shifts power to marginalized communities.</b></p>
		
		<p>I am currently an <a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/information/news/newsitem1035/3-info-sci-phds-receive-nsf-graduate-research-fellowships">NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a>
			and second year PhD student at 
			<a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/ming">Cornell Information Science</a> 
			advised by <a href="https://www.adityavashistha.com/">Aditya Vashistha</a> and <a href="http://nixdell.com/">Nicola Dell</a>.
			My research is in human-computer interaction (HCI) and information and communication technologies for development (ICTD),
			involving <b>design justice, disability justice, global health equity, caregiving, and the future of work</b>.
		</p>
		
		<p>I have almost a decade of experience designing and building technologies to reduce health inequities and fill resource gaps
			for entrepreneurs in Asia (India, Indonesia, Bangladesh), Africa (Ghana, Nigeria), and the US (NYC, Boston, Portland, Dallas).
    </p>

		<p>
			I also enjoy exploring (cities, nature, and books) and creating (food and art).
			I've been sharing some of what I've been learning through visual summaries of books and courses &mdash; 
			check out my <a href="/thoughts">thoughts</a> page for some examples!
		</p>

		<p>
			Please reach out if any of this resonates with you &mdash; 
			I love connecting with people interested in or working on social impact tech!
